# Lead-scoring-casestudy
## The Context:
X Education, an online education company, offers courses tailored for industry professionals. Each day, numerous professionals visit the company’s website, driven by marketing efforts across various platforms, including search engines like Google. Visitors to the site may browse courses, watch videos, or fill out forms with their contact information (email or phone number), classifying them as leads. Additionally, the company receives leads through referrals.

Once leads are collected, the sales team reaches out via calls and emails. However, the conversion rate is relatively low, with only about 30% of leads converting into customers. To improve this, the company aims to identify the most promising leads—referred to as ‘Hot Leads.’ By focusing on these high-potential leads, the sales team can enhance efficiency and potentially increase the conversion rate.

The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. This score will help the company target leads more effectively, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of conversion. Additionally, the model needs to be adaptable to future changes in the company’s requirements, which are detailed in a separate document.

## The Steps:

1. **Reading Data**: Load and explore the dataset.
2. **Cleaning Data**: Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis to gain insights into the data.
4. **Creating Dummies**: Convert categorical variables into dummy variables.
5. **Splitting Data**: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
6. **Building the Model**: Develop the logistic regression model.
7. **Making Predictions**: Apply the model to predict lead scores.
8. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
9. **ROC Curve**: Plot and analyze the ROC curve.
10. **Prediction on Test Set**: Evaluate the model’s performance on the test data.
11. **Precision-Recall Analysis**: Fine-tune the model based on precision and recall metrics.
